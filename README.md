# netflix-ab-testing-analysis

**End-to-end A/B testing & engagement analysis (Python + SQL + AWS)**  
Generate synthetic Netflix-style datasets, design relational schema (users & sessions), and provide SQL queries + insights for A/B test analysis.

## Project goal
Test two UI variants (Group A vs Group B) and analyze how they affect engagement (watch completion, session length, bounce rate) across regions, devices, subscription tiers, and genres.

## Tech stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy) — data generation & preprocessing  
- MySQL / SQL — analysis (queries provided)  
- (Optional) AWS S3 / RDS — for cloud storage and querying (project documents cloud usage; not required to reproduce locally)
