# 📺 Netflix A/B Testing & User Engagement Analysis (Python + SQL + AWS)

This project analyzes how changes in Netflix’s UI design impact user engagement using a simulated A/B test.  
I generated realistic synthetic user/session datasets using Python, stored them on AWS S3, modeled them in AWS RDS MySQL, and performed SQL-based analysis to measure how UI Variant B performs compared to Variant A.

The analysis reveals that **Variant B significantly improves watch completion (+18%) and reduces bounce rate (–12%)**, especially for mobile users and during night-time viewing.

# 🎯 1. Problem Statement

Netflix frequently runs A/B experiments to improve the user experience.  
This project simulates an A/B test where two different UI designs (A & B) influence:

- Watch completion  
- Bounce rate  
- Session length  
- Device-level behavior  
- Genre preferences  
- Time-of-day engagement  

The goal is to identify whether UI Variant **B** leads to improved engagement and identify behavioral patterns across segments.

# 🔍 2. Objectives

- Generate realistic, production-like datasets using Python  
- Build a normalized relational schema (users & sessions)  
- Store data in AWS S3 and model it in AWS RDS (MySQL)  
- Write advanced SQL queries for A/B testing and segmentation  
- Extract actionable product insights  
- Document a professional, end-to-end analytics workflow
